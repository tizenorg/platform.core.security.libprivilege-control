README for libprivilege-control project

libprivilege-control is a library that is designed to work with Simplified
Mandatory Access Control Kernel (SMACK/Smack) on Tizen platform.

The library introduces and works with a new abstraction layer for access control
above the SMACK's rules layer: a privilege layer.
The privilege is a group of rules combined together to represent SMACK accesses
(rights) that application needs to have in order to work with some distinctive
subsystems.
This library provides an interface allowing maintenance of application
privileges for Tizen.

The library's API is available in the header file incluce/privilege-control.h.
The API provides functions that can be used to perform security context actions
for the whole lifecycle of application: installing, running, uninstalling.
Such actions are:
- for installing:
    ->registering application in a database,
    ->setting privileges for an application that is being installed,
    ->setting up rights and giving SMACK labels for application's shared
    directiories or files,
    ->adding new privilege definitions,
- for running:
    ->setting privileges for an application that is being run,
- for uninstaling:
    ->cleaning up data set up during installation.


Internally the package implements a database of SMACK rules that are maintained
via the library API. Each time an API for changing rules is called, the rules
in database are processed and are loaded to kernel SMACK.
